## An End to Being a Student
In my 22nd year of life, I ended a very long-winded chapter -- one that I had been working towards for my entire academic career. I finally graduated from college in May and I was finally able to say that I was finished with school. The very fabric of my routine as a student was wrapping up, and I no longer needed to be preoccupied with late-night homework grinds or club academic responsibilities. 

For us college students, the year 2022 was always marked as our final destination. It was the year when we would be esteemed graduates celebrating the completion of all our hard work and becoming, most importantly, adults entering the real world. Its arrival wasn't a surprise although unexpectedly swift, especially with almost 2 full years of COVID-19 isolation. To me, it felt surreal that Graduation Day had finally come, and that there would be no future years to group me with my similarly-aged peers. For all these years, I was hiking up a mountain for so long, navigating through the twists and turns and unpaved roads, to finally reach the summit, and I was done prodding upwards.

In the months leading up to graduation, I had already known my plans for 'what's next'. I accepted my first full-time job as a [software engineer in New York City](https://datadoghq.com/), where I knew I wanted to live ever since I entered college. I planned a detailed itinerary and bucket list for my travel plans over the summer with friends and family. I started apartment hunting with a friend that I had already been roommates with in the year before. Everything made sense in terms of what was the logical next thing I should look forward to, and I had a ready plan of action.

**But no one really tells you what to expect once you've settled into adulthood.**

*Now, what's next?*

Truth be told, the idea of coding full-time wasn't too different from my experiences working on co-op, which I had already done so over the span of one and a half years. I was also already used to the city lifestyle and the (amazing) work-life balance and convenience of working remotely that came with working in the tech industry. Moving to NYC didn't strike me as daunting, despite the fact that I would have to essentially start from scratch with finding new friend groups, and daily routines and hobbies. Life after college was still fast-paced, yet there wasn't a steady stream of friends always reaching out when they had free time, and instead of hanging in huge groups, friends here felt more like smaller cliques. (Although like at the start of many social circles, the groups at work would often be very open-invite -- and as a result, events always had twenty more people than anticipated.)

I had confidence that with time, everything would be figured out, and I would find a similar life routine amidst all the differences.

But yet, from the outside looking in, family members and friends around me assumed that I already had my life figured out. Making an income and working full-time meant that I was already on my way to mastering my finances and filing a gajillion tax documents. That I knew what career I would ultimately settle on for the rest of my life. That I would know where to search for my partner and where I'd live.
